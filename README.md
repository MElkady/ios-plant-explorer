# Plant explorer
Plant explorer is a simple iOS application that utilize ML to regonize plants. I started this application as a weekend experiment, let's see where it ends :)

### Library usage
Plant explorer makes use of the following libraries:
* [aiy/vision/classifier/plants_V1](https://tfhub.dev/google/lite-model/aiy/vision/classifier/plants_V1/3) - TensorFlow lite model to classify plants
* [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) - To create UI

This project requires XCode 12.0beta5 (or higher) & runs only on iOS 14.0 (or higher).


### Contribution
This is mainly a learning project but any pull requests with nice ideas are always welcome
